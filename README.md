### Marketplace template
(notes on the template)<br>
This repository is an example of an application running on the [Liteflow](https://liteflow.com) infrastructure to showcase the uses of the infrastructure and/or be used as a starter kit to launch a product fast. The theme is based on [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and can be [customized](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/customize-theme) in the `/styles/theme.ts` file.

#### Application
Marketplace template includes default navigation, metadata, and wallets that can be updated directly from the `pages/_app.tsx` file.
